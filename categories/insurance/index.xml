      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If You&#39;re Not Paying, You&#39;re The Product&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- The Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might already know Finance Fox - &amp;ldquo;My Insurance Hero&amp;rdquo;. This is going to be a short review with my experience I had using them for about a year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Fox is a platform/app that allows you to manage your insurances and other financial contracts that you might own. They also claim that they can optimize those for you.&lt;br&gt;
Their promise/service is that they claim to be your personal, always available broker that handles all your claims, cases and problems you might have with your contracts for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
