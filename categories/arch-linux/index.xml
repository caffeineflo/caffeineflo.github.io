      <description>I was posting about the watchdog device on the raspberry pi a few days ago and how to solve a specific error with the configuration on the pi.
In the meantime I had the watchdog device running for a few days and it worked &amp;hellip; kind of &amp;hellip;
One should know, that the watchdog devices halts the pi immediately, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a clean shutoff but more like you would pull the power plug of the pi.</description>
