The conference was superb! But more to that later.
One talk that I&rsquo;ve heard there last week already came back to me, which I like to write about now:
@sh&rsquo;s talk &ldquo;How to improve at support as a developer&rdquo;
The talk centered around the language you use when facing customers and what impact it has between talking like a human being or some neutral robot.
Now I won&rsquo;t be able to capture in writing how awesome the talk was or what a great speaker Sarah Hatter is, but I want you to profit from the talk, so let me refer you to @bsndesign&rsquo;s notes to said talk:">
