Let me give you six reasons why you should come:

Sam Davies will give &ldquo;A Fun iOS 11 Workshop&rdquo; on Sunday, Aug 13th
On Monday, Aug 14th Joe Cieplinski will talk about &ldquo;Getting Past No: The Science of Moving Others&rdquo;
Jay Freeman (Too many references to link to) will be talking about himself?! Anyways, I&rsquo;m sure his session is going to be great!
The same day (Aug 15th) Ben DiFrancesco will be talking about &ldquo;Threads, Queues, and Things to Come: The Present and Future of Concurrency in Swift&rdquo;
And on the last day (after my talk, which you should visit), hear Andrew Morrow talk about &ldquo;Using C Libraries in Swift 3&rdquo;
And with all these great sessions in mind, don&rsquo;t miss me talking about &ldquo;The Internet of Things and iOS: Don’t let your toaster bring down the internet!&rdquo; on Sunday Aug 16th
