      <description>I have recently reported about my new website and the workflow I am using. More specifically about Hugo and GitHub pages.
One task GitHub Pages solves perfectly is the need to publish changes. GitHub Pages does that automatically for you, which is one reason I chose it in first place. Due to the limitations on https with custom domains though, I decided to self host my HTML pages once more.</description>
