      <description>With BlackFriday and CyberMonday just behind us, a lot of us have received strange iCloud calendar invites like I did.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for that and certainly it&amp;rsquo;s annoying as they have no value to anyone.
Why did we receive those invites? Spammers are sending emails out to email addresses they scraped off of google search results or to email addresses they know from breaches or data they bought. With iClouds ability to auto convert special encoded emails into calendar invites you&amp;rsquo;ll never see the actual email they sent you, but only the annoying calendar invite.</description>
