I&amp;rsquo;ve been an electric unicycle rider for a bit over a year now and it seems as there&amp;rsquo;s a big problem with all the different brands of EUCs (electric unicycle) that are out there: Their Apps
When riding a electric unicycle, you need an app from time to time to change the settings of your EUC or track your path, battery or any of those metrics.</description>
