      <description>360iDev is coming fast and you should come! Why?
Let me give you six reasons why you should come:
 Sam Davies will give &amp;ldquo;A Fun iOS 11 Workshop&amp;rdquo; on Sunday, Aug 13th
 On Monday, Aug 14th Joe Cieplinski will talk about &amp;ldquo;Getting Past No: The Science of Moving Others&amp;rdquo;
 Jay Freeman (Too many references to link to) will be talking about himself?! Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m sure his session is going to be great!</description>
