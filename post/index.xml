      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for my upcoming conference talk &lt;a href=&#34;https://360idev.com/sessions/internet-things-ios-dont-let-toaster-bring-internet/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Internet of Things and iOS: Don‚Äôt let your toaster bring down the internet!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; I have been doing a lot of research on the Mirai botnet.&lt;br&gt;
The Mirai (Japanese for &amp;ldquo;The Future&amp;rdquo;) botnet was used in a DDoS attack against the DNS service provider Dyn on October 21st, 2016.&lt;br&gt;
In this attack, some IoT devices were used to block their servers, bringing down popular sites such as&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Join me at 360iDev - The Leading Indie iOS/macOS Developer Conference</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/360idev2017-denver/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;360iDev is coming fast and you should come! Why?&lt;br&gt;
Let me give you six reasons why you should come:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/samdavies&#34;&gt;Sam Davies&lt;/a&gt; will give &amp;ldquo;A Fun iOS 11 Workshop&amp;rdquo; on Sunday, Aug 13th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Monday, Aug 14th &lt;a href=&#34;https://releasenotes.tv/aboutthepodcast/&#34;&gt;Joe Cieplinski&lt;/a&gt; will talk about &amp;ldquo;Getting Past No: The Science of Moving Others&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jay Freeman (Too many references to link to) will be talking about himself?! Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m sure his session is going to be great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same day (Aug 15th) Ben DiFrancesco will be talking about &amp;ldquo;Threads, Queues, and Things to Come: The Present and Future of Concurrency in Swift&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on the last day (after my talk, which you should visit), hear Andrew Morrow talk about &amp;ldquo;Using C Libraries in Swift 3&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And with all these great sessions in mind, don&amp;rsquo;t miss me talking about &amp;ldquo;The Internet of Things and iOS: Don‚Äôt let your toaster bring down the internet!&amp;rdquo; on Sunday Aug 16th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t already enough, I have something special planned for my talk, that includes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ESP8266 Special: Apple&#39;s HomeKit is now for everyone!</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-homekit-special/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Apple held it&amp;rsquo;s annual WWDC keynote announcing the latest updates to their platforms and technologies. The keynote lasted over 2 hours and you might would think that in that much time they have touched at least all technologies on the surface, but one thing especially seemed to have been missing almost entirely. HomeKit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Apple seemed to have not shown too much love to that topic during their Keynote, it seems as if they still have given that technology quite some thought leading up to WWDC as Apple quietly made quite a few changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup Git Push To Securly Update Your Website</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/setup-git-remote-publishing/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;üìù Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This post was published in 2017. While the core git concepts remain valid, modern deployment practices often favor SSH keys over passwords, GitHub Actions for automation, or managed deployment platforms. This approach is still functional but represents one of several deployment strategies available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently reported about my new website and the workflow I am using. More specifically about Hugo and GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One task GitHub Pages solves perfectly is the need to publish changes. GitHub Pages does that automatically for you, which is one reason I chose it in first place. Due to the limitations on https with custom domains though, I decided to self host my HTML pages once more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Ghost to Hugo. Easier Blog Hosting with Github Pages</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/from-ghost-to-hugo-easier-blog-hosting-with-github-pages/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;üìù Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This post was published in 2017. While Hugo and GitHub Pages remain relevant, some specific tools and approaches mentioned have evolved. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s syntax and GitHub Pages features have improved since publication. This is preserved as historical reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the publication of this post, my transition from Ghost to Hugo will be complete and this blog will be solely run with static HTML files compared to the dynamic Ghost installation I used before.
Let me explain why I did this and how you can do this as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a ESP8266 Weather Station with MQTT, HomeKit and WebInterface Part III</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-part-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-iii&#34;&gt;Part III&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part III of a series of tutorials that build up on each other. If you missed the first parts, you can find it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-part-1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-part-2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part we&amp;rsquo;re going to use the esp8266 chip with the DHT11 sensor from part I to connect to our MQTT server from part II and publish the sensors data. Finally, we are going to build a iOS app to display our data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unicycling: One App For All EUCs</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/unicycling-one-app-for-all-eucs/</link>

      <guid>https://iflorian.com/unicycling-one-app-for-all-eucs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week ago I started a new project. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to talk about it as it&amp;rsquo;s coming along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unicycling app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been an electric unicycle rider for a bit over a year now and it seems as there&amp;rsquo;s a big problem with all the different brands of EUCs (electric unicycle) that are out there: Their Apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When riding a electric unicycle, you need an app from time to time to change the settings of your EUC or track your path, battery or any of those metrics.
While all EUC brands I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far provide an app, they come in different levels of usability and each with a different feature set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If You&#39;re Not Paying, You&#39;re The Product&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- The Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might already know Finance Fox - &amp;ldquo;My Insurance Hero&amp;rdquo;. This is going to be a short review with my experience I had using them for about a year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Fox is a platform/app that allows you to manage your insurances and other financial contracts that you might own. They also claim that they can optimize those for you.&lt;br&gt;
Their promise/service is that they claim to be your personal, always available broker that handles all your claims, cases and problems you might have with your contracts for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Update] Watchdog On The Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/update-watchdog-on-the-raspberry-pi/</link>

      <guid>https://iflorian.com/update-watchdog-on-the-raspberry-pi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was posting about the watchdog device on the raspberry pi a few days ago and how to solve a specific error with the configuration on the pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I had the watchdog device running for a few days and it worked &amp;hellip; kind of &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should know, that the watchdog devices halts the pi immediately, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a clean shutoff but more like you would pull the power plug of the pi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a ESP8266 Weather Station with MQTT, HomeKit and WebInterface Part II</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-part-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-ii&#34;&gt;Part II&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part II of a series of tutorials that build up on each other. If you missed the first part, you can find it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iflorian.com/esp8266-weather-station-part-1/&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II is going to be a little bit slower than part I, simply because we have to make a few preparations in order to keep going faster again in part III.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at MQTT by going over the idea what this protocol does before we go ahead and setup a MQTT server that we&amp;rsquo;re going to use in part III to communicate with our little weather station.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenVPN block-outside-dns</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/openvpn-block-outside-ds/</link>

      <guid>https://iflorian.com/openvpn-block-outside-ds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had issues with my VPN setup, specifically with my VPN over at premiumize.me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seem to have added the &lt;code&gt;block-outside-dns&lt;/code&gt; option to their OpenVPN setup. As that&amp;rsquo;s a Windows only question it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on my OS X/Arch Linux machine and causes problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error message was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unrecognized option or missing or extra parameter(s) in [PUSH-OPTIONS]:6: block-outside-dns (2.4.0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can fix that (given you run OpenVPN &amp;gt;= 2.4.0) by adding the following line to your client config:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Watchdog - cannot set timeout 16 (errno = 22 = &#39;Invalid argument&#39;)</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/watchdog-cannot-set-timeout-16-errno-22-invalid-argument/</link>

      <guid>https://iflorian.com/watchdog-cannot-set-timeout-16-errno-22-invalid-argument/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seen that error before?&lt;br&gt;
Possibly on a Raspberry Pi 2/3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seems to have problems guiding you to the right solution, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add  &lt;code&gt;watchdog-timeout = 15&lt;/code&gt;  to your watchdog.conf file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that? The Broadcom BCM2835 Watchdog timer only supports 15 seconds timeout ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2016 - My year in review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know, I know &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit late for a review, but here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2016 was a year that forced me to travel a lot. I gained my H1B which forced me to go places and have me go back and forth.&lt;br&gt;
I flew 4 times to Atlanta, went to Egypt, Brussels, Rio, Florianopolis, Sao Paulo, Indianapolis, Denver, Milan, Istanbul and Santo Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to build something exciting together and you guessed right - it has to do with the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we do more and more IoT business for our clients, we as software developers also get more and more into the hardware part of the equation. Which is an important part when you truly want to understand and solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this and to share my knowledge with you in the best possible way, I made a project that will will help illuminate what&amp;rsquo;s behind IoT. You don&amp;rsquo;t need much hardware to follow along, here&amp;rsquo;s what you need:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xcode 8: PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</title>
      <link>https://iflorian.com/xcode-8-provisioning_profile_specifier/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:46:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://iflorian.com/xcode-8-provisioning_profile_specifier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a few problems with signing my apps due to some Xcode 8 changes, mainly the difference between using &lt;code&gt;PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PROVISIONING_PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; to specify your provisioning profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are wonderful blog posts out there that describe the process in detail, here&amp;rsquo;s what I found important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER&lt;/code&gt; setting is used to indicate the type of signing method that should be used for a given target. Targets that want to employ the manual method of code signing will not use this setting, and will instead use the deprecated &lt;code&gt;PROVISIONING_PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; build setting. If the setting is set then, the new automatic code signing method will take over.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all those scripts behind us, we should get a signed IPA in our OUTPUTDIR. From here on, we can use this IPA and distribute it to our testers. A few options are to either upload our IPA with curl to a custom FTP Directory or our XCode Server or some other custom routine. For this example we stay &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; and upload our App to HockeyApp via curl.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to &lt;a href=&#34;https://releasenotes.tv/conference/&#34;&gt;ReleaseNotes&lt;/a&gt; last week. ReleaseNotes is a indie conference mainly centered around the topic on &amp;ldquo;How to build a business&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was superb! But more to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One talk that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard there last week already came back to me, which I like to write about now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sh&#34;&gt;@sh&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;How to improve at support as a developer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk centered around the language you use when facing customers and what impact it has between talking like a human being or some neutral robot.
Now I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to capture in writing how awesome the talk was or what a great speaker Sarah Hatter is, but I want you to profit from the talk, so let me refer you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bsndesign&#34;&gt;@bsndesign&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; notes to said talk:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://360idev.com&#34;&gt;360iDev&lt;/a&gt; conference in Denver. This year was my second year that I attended 360iDev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, it&amp;rsquo;s an iOS conference focusing on everything related to iOS Development. The conference lasts four days and usually has at least 3-4 different topics going at the same time so that everyone can find a topic they like at any given time.  The topics can be grouped into either iOS, technical or business topics. That might sound a bit like every other conference, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t told you the best part yet: 360iDev&amp;rsquo;s community!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve made it! Welcome to my blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I wanted to write my own blog and share my opinion with the rest of the world. Now I finally took some time and created this little blog. I hope everyone can enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start reading through my blog, let me introduce myself:
My name is Florian. I&amp;rsquo;m a German expat living in the US. Software Engineering is what I studied and what I currently do in my full time job.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about technical things like the coding I&amp;rsquo;m doing (iOS and Backend stuff), some of my hobbies (electric unicycling, 3D printing) or whatever comes into my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
